# Crash recovery and reorg semantics (store)

Hard kills (`kill -9`) and tip disconnects are normal. **Corrupt Class A / Class C
payloads are not repaired in-process** — reindex / redo IBD. Derived `tx.head` in
the **current** layout that is unreadable (truncated sealed MPHF, empty/short
`meta`, other open errors) **rebuilds from Class A** when bodies exist. Leftover
**prior layouts** (fuse8 v1, flat `tx.head.meta`) still **refuse**.

## Tip as commit point

Best-chain views ignore uncommitted Class C state:

| Write order (confirm **write** thread) | Role |
|-------------------------------------------|------|
| 0. Structural spentness / maturity / subsidy | No durable tip write yet |
| 1. `strong_tx` (L2 RAM) | May lead tip after kill **before** barrier |
| 2. Height-fence extend (RAM), then `confirmed[]` tip advance (L2 RAM) | In-process commit |
| 3. **`flush_class_c_tip`** (headers, then `strong_tx`, `header_txs`, `confirmed[]` last) | **Durability barrier** |
| 3b. Scripthash write-behind enqueue | After tip. Direct IBD defers SH until tip entry |
| 4. Body-queue dequeue for those heights | Only after confirm-write returns Ok |
| 5. Spend annotations (Direct) | After tip. A missing slot is unspent until open replays from the marker |

`is_confirmed_strong(tx)` ⇔ strong ∧ height fence contains the fk. Queries that mean “on best chain” use this (or equivalent). Confirmed-tx **API** readers pin that tip (`Query::pin_chain_view` / `still_live`) and retry on disconnect rather than pausing the writer — [`concurrency.md`](./concurrency.md#confirmed-tx-readers-pin--retry-not-a-lock).

On open (in order):

1. Soft `store/tip_seal` (if present): clamp confirmed tip that advanced without a complete barrier seal.
2. **Tip-window revalidate** (Core `-checkblocks`, default 6, `0` = all): first drop any trailing null `confirmed[]` slots (HWM ahead of last real tip), then the last N confirmed heights — `prev_fk`/hash chain, `header_txs` range bounds, merkle root from `txid.body`, those N runs all-strong, and parent edges on `input`. For each create in a checked block, `input` must be stamped, the edge count must match the `seqsigwit` input count (skipped under `--prune-seqsigwit`), the first tx must be the only coinbase edge, and every other edge must name an existing create with an in-range vout. A missing `spend_durable` file is the whole chain (`n == 0`): nothing has been device-flushed, and a matching last 6 heights is not a proof. A present marker widens any other window to at least 6 and far enough to cover `(D, tip]`. `checkblocks=0` stays the whole chain. On failure: clear bad Class A association and/or shrink tip to last good height, rebuild the fence, flush confirmed. A short new-layout `input` high-water mark is Class A count skew: open truncates the other stems to the stamped input count before this window, so a `header_txs` range past that count shrinks the tip. Open does not stamp `n_in = 0` onto `PREV_ON_INPUTS` creates. A legacy store with no `input` file, or a partial legacy tail whose next record still has an inline prevout, still backfills edges from `seqsigwit`.
3. One `repair_class_c_above_tip`: unstrong bits **not on the fence** via complement ranges (holes + suffix until a zero page). Does **not** walk every set bit. Logs `class_c repair cleared= ranges= ms=` even when zero.
4. Replay spend annotations for every height in `(A, tip]` (`spend_durable` annotated-through). A missing file has no device-flushed cursor, so `A = 0` and the chain is rewritten. `finish_post_commit_hashes` is idempotent. Then `sync_data` the replay inputs and publish `A` and durable-through `D` at the surviving tip. The replay logs height progress every 10 seconds.

In-process completion-session recover (IBD write/lookup/load/scripts and tip connect) consumes a 1000-height credit and requeues; it does **not** run `repair_class_c_above_tip` (lookup would race the write thread's strong-before-fence window). Abandoned leftover strong is the same as kill-9 and is repaired on the next open. Does **not** truncate Class A. Tip stays the commit point.

Open revalidation runs in `Query::open_or_create` **before** P2P can extend tip.

### L2 write-behind + body queue (phase 6)

- Compact Class C (`confirmed`, `header_txs_*`, `strong_tx`) mutate **RAM only** during the commit batch. The height fence is RAM-only (derived from those tables).
- **Connect** barrier order on disk (**tip last**): `strong_tx` → `header_txs` → **`confirmed[]` last**.
  - Mid-barrier kill after pre-tip tables: tip stays old; leftover strong not on the fence is repaired by `repair_class_c_above_tip`.
  - Never flush `confirmed` before strong on connect — tip with permanent unstrong txs (repair only clears leftover strong).
- **Disconnect** barrier order (**tip first** — opposite of connect):
  1. SH unlink only (do not unstrong yet).
  2. `confirmed` truncate + fence pop → `flush_confirmed_only` (durable tip shrink).
  3. Then `set_unstrong` → flush strong.
  - Mid-kill after tip shrink: leftover strong is **not on the new fence** → repairable.
  - Never unstrong while tip is still high — permanent unstrong-at-tip.
- Append-only tip extension writes **suffix only**. In-prefix full rewrites residual; tip-last connect + tip-first disconnect + BQ re-drive mitigate.
- Prefer **loss of uncommitted tip progress** over **tip-ahead-of-strong** or **tip-high-with-unstrong**.

## Class A (archive)

- Append-oriented; re-archive is **idempotent** when `header_txs` already present.
- **Never leads tip:** Class A is published only on the confirm-write path with tip advance in the same era (no dual-track archive-ahead).
- Kill mid-archive without a complete body association ⇒ not treated as archived; re-getdata.

## Spends (v5: annotation on create outputs)

- Sole spender: 8 B slot on **`spent.body`**. Multi: `MULTI_SPENDER` + `spent.ovf` list.
- Class A may write same-batch sole `spend_fk` into the spent stem (creates in that append wave). Historical parents stay zero until annotate **after tip**.
- Annotations may remain after disconnect / for non-strong spenders.
- Best-chain spentness: annotation + `is_confirmed_strong(spender)`. Same-batch pre-fill is not strong until this batch's Class C.
- Kill-safe for a stale annotation: non-strong fields do not false-positive if the filter is applied.
- A missing annotation is not kill-safe. Open replays `(A, tip]` from the block bodies, then advances `A` only after `sync_data`. `A` never exceeds tip. Disconnect below `A` lowers `A`.
- A confirm write that fails after its tip commit (live index seal, spend annotate) leaves its first height pending in process. The next confirm write replays `[pending, tip]` before structural, and returns the replay error without validating if that fails. The spend snapshot does not advance past the pending heights, a disconnect lowers it to the new tip, and a snapshot note is capped at the confirmed tip it reads in the same atomic update. The checkpoint also never publishes `A` at or above a pending height.
- No `point.head` (v4 open-hash multimap removed).
- Class A is **three stems** (`txout` / `seqsigwit` / `spent`); bare-meta puts are rejected. Packed `tx.body` with creates is refused on open.

## Thin scripthash (Electrum outpoint pointers)

- Schema 18: the head value holds **one** inline create (`SH_INLINE_CAP`), a geometric **slab** (3–256 fks, ULEB128
  deltas), or a megakey **page chain** (≥257). Size-class freelist reuses freed slabs.
  Main heads are sealed MPHF+pack8 (no fuse); new keys go to global ingest OA.
- **No spend columns** — spentness is the `spent.body` annotation plus `is_confirmed_strong`.
- Direct IBD does not enqueue SH creates. Tip write-behind runs after `flush_class_c_tip`. Tip entry bulk-materializes from Class A.
- **Kill-safe without chain walks:** first confirm after open **sequentially scans**
  `scripthash.body` once into a process set of `create_tx_fk`s already present;
  re-confirm skips those txs. Hot path only appends + maintains heads in RAM.
- Creates for unstrong / above-tip txs are **invisible** via `is_confirmed_strong`.
- Disconnect tip: **unlink** creates for that block’s outputs (tombstone + rewire);
  process set updated so re-confirm can re-index.
- No tip-mode full rebuild; corrupt index ⇒ reindex (wipe store / redo IBD).

## Flush

Clean shutdown: `flush_for_shutdown` fsyncs tip/Class C (incl. L2 dirty images) then async Class A.
Steady path: payload pwrite + HWM publish; `sync_data` on flush barriers.
Kill mid-payload before HWM publish: readers never see past previous published length.

Connect barrier (`flush_class_c_tip`): headers (if dirty) → strong → header_txs → **confirmed last** → soft `tip_seal` (tmp + `sync_all` + rename + parent-directory `fsync`). The height fence is RAM-only and is not flushed. The barrier does not `sync_data` Class A.
Disconnect: confirmed truncate + `flush_confirmed_only` (also refreshes `tip_seal`) before unstrong/height clear. If the new tip is below `spend_durable`, that marker is lowered to the tip.

Confirm stores a snapshot height after annotations are written and does not `sync_data` these stems. `rbtc-spend-sync` does, about every 10 minutes: `sync_data` on the replay stems and `spenders` (not a high-water rewrite, not `tx.head`), then if the confirmed tip is still at least that snapshot, publish `A = D` at the snapshot. Blocks appended above the snapshot during the barrier are flushed along and are not claimed. A disconnect bumps an in-process generation before it lowers the snapshot and the marker, including when no marker file exists yet. The checkpoint samples that generation before `sync_data` and again under the marker lock; it publishes only when the generation is unchanged, the tip is still at least the snapshot, and no annotate is pending. A disconnect and a reconnect of a different block at the snapshot height during that window leave the previous marker in place. An append strictly above the snapshot does not bump the generation, so the marker still publishes. One still pending caps `A` below its first height. A failed marker publish leaves the previous marker and does not start a new interval. Shutdown wakes the thread for one checkpoint, joins it, then runs `flush_for_shutdown`. The barrier is `File::sync_data` (Linux `fdatasync`, macOS `F_FULLFSYNC`, Windows `FlushFileBuffers`). It is not inside `flush_class_c_tip`, and it is not charged on the confirm thread's `ann_sync` timer. A cookie inside a data file, or a clean page cache, is not this cursor: writeback is not a device flush, and the kernel may reorder data ahead of a later header write.

| Write | Rebuild from durable tip + bodies? | Fsync |
|-------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| Class C barrier (`strong`, `header_txs`, `confirmed`, `tip_seal`) | No. This is the commit point. | Every barrier |
| Spend annotations (`spent.body`, `spenders`) | Yes, from the block body and parent outputs, when those bytes are durable | `rbtc-spend-sync` about every 10 minutes, then advance `A` to the pre-sync snapshot |
| Class A bodies the tip window reads (`txid.body` for the merkle root, `input` edges, `seqsigwit` input count unless pruned) plus the strong bits | No. A torn page cannot be rebuilt from the tip | Same `sync_data`, which advances durable-through `D` to that snapshot. Open revalidates `(D, tip]` (at least the last 6) when the marker is present, and from genesis when it is missing. The window does not read `txout` or `txstat` |
| Scripthash heads, `tx.head` | Yes, from Class A | No barrier `fsync`. SH write-behind syncs the SH tables before it advances `scripthash.include_hwm` (a tip block, the end of a catch-up burst, or ≥1 s since the last advance); recovery replays the idempotent appends above that HWM. `sync=` on `tip: accept`. `tx.head` insert syncs `meta` but not the open tail's slot pages, so after a power loss the tail can miss a connected create that `meta` still counts; open backfills only past that count. A roll syncs the pages it closes, holes included, and the segment's probes read those pages until its background seal publishes. The seal rebuilds the rows from `txid.body` and syncs its files before `meta` names it sealed. So a lost row can sit in any unsealed segment: the open tail or the in-flight seal. An IBD missing-parent verdict scans `txid.body` from the oldest unsealed segment's first fk, read before the head read, and treats such a miss as `Corrupt` ([089](./external_findings/089-missing-parent-verdict.md)) |
| BIP-352 tweaks (`sp_tweaks.*`) | Yes, backfill from Class A | Each put syncs body, then idx. Open drops heights above the tip and fits the last record to its `n_tx` |
| Mempool sidecar | No. RAM is source of truth. Open keeps an in-range prefix and moves an unreadable image aside | 5 s path and shutdown `flush`: `sync_data` body, then slots, then meta |

`tx.head` meta and the spend marker use the same parent-directory `fsync` as `tip_seal` after tmp+rename. Windows denies that directory handle; the file was already synced. A missing `spend_durable` revalidates and replays from genesis. `checkblocks=0` still walks from genesis when a marker is present.

## Mempool sidecar (`{datadir}/mempool/`)

Private, **not** Class A. RAM graph is source of truth; files may lag.

- **Order:** `persist_due` and shutdown `flush` write the packed `tx.body` tail, `sync_data` that file, then write LIVE slots and `sync_data` those, then `meta`. `persist_due` `pwrite`s only new LIVE slot records (not the full table). A crash after the body sync and before the new slots loses those admits. Open skips a LIVE row whose `body_off + body_len` sits past the logical body and keeps the in-range prefix. Compact stays tmp+rename of packed images (reclaim).
- **5 s admits:** one `fdatasync` of the dirty body, then the slot sync, per dirty interval, from the tip-follow perf tick. Admits that missed that sync can still be lost (relay re-fetch). Shutdown `flush` generation-bumps and uses the same sync order.
- **Unreadable image:** bad magic, a schema this binary does not accept, or an in-range payload that does not decode or whose txid does not match the slot. Open moves `meta`, `slots`, `tx.body`, and their `.tmp` files under `mempool/torn-<unix>/` and starts empty. `fee_history` and `fee_history.log` stay. An IO error (the mempool path is not a directory, or the open returns IO rather than corrupt, magic, or schema) still fails startup. Class A is untouched.
- **DEAD:** already-durable slots are a one-byte `pwrite` of the status. A block strip, conflict eviction, or other removal batch `fdatasync`s `slots` once, then writes `meta`. Open reloads from slot status and sets `live_count` from that scan, so a crash after the slots sync and before `meta` keeps the DEAD rows. A crash before the slots sync can resurrect those txs (same class as a lost admit: the body bytes are unchanged and still decode). An admit that never hit disk stays RAM-only (crash loses it). Do not dump the full slot table on strip — that would write LIVE rows whose body is still in the unpersisted tail.
- **Leftover schema 1:** convert on open (recode LIVE payloads, tmp+rename like compact). Vin aux is empty; SH reindex batch-fills. Unknown schema takes the unreadable-image path above.

## Operator

- Direct IBD keeps segmented **`tx.head/`** (archive) and **spend annotations** (confirm) live; tip entry does **not** re-scan Class A to repair them. Corrupt head/spends ⇒ reindex (optional manual `backfill_tx_index` rebuilds segmented head mappings from Class A).
- **Segmented `tx.head`:** directory `tx.head/` with `meta` + open OA `NNNNNN`; sealed `NNNNNN.mphf` + `.fuse8`. Packed BDZ `g` is FdOnly (4 KiB page stream); MPHF output is `rel−1`. Flat `tx.head.meta` **refuses** on open (wipe `store/tx.head`; Class A kept). Roll opens the next OA first; seal runs on a sidecar and publishes later. Seal/install of `meta` / `.mphf` is sibling tmp + `sync_all` then rename (empty truncate of the live name is not a seal). Publish persists sealed `meta` **before** unlinking the segment's OA; a leftover OA next to a sealed `.mphf` is discarded on open. Kill mid-seal leaves **at most one** unsealed non-tail OA: open collects fuse keys once from `txid.body` and seals it (does not retain `open_keys`). Two unsealed non-tails is **Corrupt**. Leftover fuse8 v1 and flat `tx.head.meta` **refuse** (`Query::open`); wipe `store/tx.head` (Class A kept) then restart. Unreadable **current** head (empty/truncated `meta`, truncated/missing sealed MPHF) with Class A: wipe+rebuild from `txid.body` (same cost as a clean wipe). Wipe or empty occupancy + Class A: open rebuilds **MPHF+fuse8 directly** from `txid.body` in parallel (default **2²⁵** keys/range; `RBITCOIN_TX_HEAD_REBUILD_WORKERS`); no historical OA. Legacy mono `tx.head` file / `.new` / `.resize` are not opened — reindex.
- Scripthash: Direct IBD **defers** SH (no memtable, no confirm enqueue). After the horizon, two Class A `txout` scans: each worker owns a contiguous create-fk span and unsized maps (1.5 GiB estimate cap; spill the largest shard map while over budget; one writer, 1-slot queue) into `scripthash.unsorted/keys/NN/` (`SHKSP01` files, first-fk delta singles; tmp+rename, not a kill-9 barrier — no `DONE.keys` still wipes unsorted); merge folds those spills into one map, one walk to `scripthash.head/NN` + `multi/NN.fuse8`, and unlinks `keys/NN/`; then fuse-hit `post` (`SHPST01` spills under `post/NN/`), pack folds those spills then 2+ bodies, unlink each shard's extract as it seals. A **durable head** on restart stays Tip: write-behind / `recover_sh_writebehind` fills any HWM lag; leftover `scripthash.runs` are discarded (not WarmOnly-merged).
  - **Full cold** when head empty. **`RBITCOIN_SH_FORCE_REBUILD=1`:** wipe head + full two-scan collect + pack. Empty collect after Class A creates remain is fatal.
  - **Cold resume:** the pack commit is `scripthash.head/NN.packed` (sibling of the MPHF base; holes stay). Open loads a shard's MPHF only when that mark exists. `MphfHead::exists` after pass-1 BDZ is **not** pack-done. A complete unmarked head (every shard has `.mphf`+`.val`, and `scripthash.unsorted` has no `DONE.keys` / `DONE.post` / `keys/` / `post/`) is soft-migrated: the marks are written, and a missing `include_hwm` is set from the create count. An extract still on disk never gets a mark, even if `include_hwm` already names the tip. No valid `DONE.keys` (including leftover `SHUNSRT3` / 24 B `NN`, or `keys/NN` / `post/NN` as a file) deletes unsorted and restarts pass 1. A spill whose first 8 B are not `SHKSP01` is Corrupt — wipe unsorted; do not parse or migrate. `DONE.keys` / `DONE.post` record the inclusive Class A `create_fk` scanned (`SHKEYS02` last_fk marker / `SHPOST02`). Missing current `keys/NN/` spills with unsealed shards finishes BDZ from those files. Head files present and no `DONE.post` restarts pass 2 from fk 1 (partial `post/` spills are deleted and recollected). Packing a shard soft-clears ingest keys that packed main now owns, so a tip append that landed on ingest while the shard was unsealed cannot hide that chain. A `post/NN` **file**, or a spill whose first 8 B are not `SHPST01`, is Corrupt (wipe unsorted). If Class A grew after `DONE.post` and **no** shards are packed, append postings. If any shard is already pack-marked, pack remaining unsealed `post/NN/`, then Class A tail-append onto the durable head (Direct write-behind no-ops). After all shards seal, the unsorted dir is removed.
  Empty head + leftover catalog: wipe leftover runs + SEAL, then Class A collect (not k-way from `scripthash.runs`). Durable head: leftover runs are discarded, `SEAL` kept; missing `include_hwm` bootstraps from SEAL. Inclusion HWM: `scripthash.include_hwm`. **Leftover live OA** at `scripthash.head` (or non-`SHSR` `ovf/NNNNNN`): refuse — wipe `store/scripthash*` and restart with `--sh-index`.
  **SH head open:** sealed **main** shards load `.idx` only (one entry per 128
  records; no fuse). Sealed **ovf** loads `.idx` + BF8R. Occupancy scan is not
  used on those files. A schema-14 page-era durable index is **refused** (wipe
  `store/scripthash*` and rematerialize). Ingest OA still uses `{ingest}.occ`.
